Revision history for Test-Mocha

0.50    2013-11-18  Major interface change

    - dies() is now throws().
    - verify() is now called_ok().
    - stub(), called_ok() and inspect() now take a coderef with a method
      spec instead of a mock object.
    - Backwards compatibility has been maintained with deprecation warnings.
    - Carp 1.11 is no longer supported.

0.21_02 2013-10-24

    - Enable isa(), DOES() and can() to be stubbed and verified.
    - Fix test failure with Carp 1.11 where Carp::Heavy calls ref() on mocks.
    - Skip failing tests with Test::Builder::Test 1.23_002 where
      `test_out(qr//)` does not work because it tries to stringify `qr//`.
